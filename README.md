Udemy course: asp-net-mvc-core-and-angular-5-project-creating-a-cms
This is a project from the udemy course mentioned above. I am using it to refresh my knowledge of angular and doing it with dot net core makes it all the more interesting. Please see the link below. It is a wonderful course. I bought it today having stayed at home for one ten days (after losing my job on the 30th of July) to refresh my skills and keep myself engaged. I found it concise (~4hrs) and packed with loads of information. Below is the link should you want to try the course.

The technology stack for this project are:
1. ASP.NET CORE (3.1) for the (REST) Web API Projects
2. Angular 9.0 / 10.0 for the client project
3. Entity Framework Core as our data access layer
4. MSSQL Server as the database.

Approach:
The approach is to follow the course content and complete this project as quickly as possible. After that, I will come back to redesign the project, employing different design patterns as need be and using the SOLID principles to achieve total decoupling. Next, will be to convert the Web APIs into a micro service.
